## About the Site

This site serves as a living technical portfolio. It documents current and past projects, long-term learning tracks, and professional goals related to:

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Software Engineering and Systems Programming (Python, C++)
- Full-Stack Web Development (FastAPI, React, Docker)
- Equity and representation in tech

Each section is designed to grow alongside my skill set and experience as I prepare for a career in artificial intelligence and software engineering.
