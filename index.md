I'm a Computer Science student at CSU San Bernardino with a focus on building real-world systems in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and full-stack web development. I work with technologies like Python, C++, FastAPI, Docker, and React. My current projects apply machine learning to NLP, data classification, and image processing.
