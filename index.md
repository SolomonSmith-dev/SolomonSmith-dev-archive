# Solomon Smith

I'm a Computer Science student at CSU San Bernardino with a focus on building real-world systems in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and full-stack web development. I build with technologies like Python, C++, FastAPI, Docker, and React, and I'm currently developing projects that apply machine learning to NLP, data classification, and image processing.
