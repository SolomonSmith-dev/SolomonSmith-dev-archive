Welcome to my new blog. I'm using this space to document my progress as a computer science student and future AI engineer.

Here’s what I’ll be sharing here:
- Projects I’m working on each week
- Tools and concepts I’m learning (especially in AI, ML, C++, and full-stack development)
- Wins, failures, and lessons learned
- Real reflections on what it takes to level up

I’m starting this blog as part of my goal to build a professional, transparent, and technically solid online presence. Stay tuned — I’ll be posting updates regularly.
